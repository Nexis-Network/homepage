A Nexis Network account subscribed to a paid plan can manage billing from the **Billing** page in the Nexis Network Console. On the **Billing** page, you can:

- View charges for the current month
- Update your billing email
- Update your payment method
- View and download invoices
- Downgrade your plan

For Nexis Network Free Tier accounts, the **Billing** page allows users to view [Nexis Network Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) usage limits, learn about [Nexis Network Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) features, and estimate monthly Nexis Network Pro Plan cost based on your current usage.

## View the billing page

To access your **Billing** page:

1. Navigate to the Nexis Network Console.
1. Select **Billing** from the sidebar.

## Update your payment method

To update your payment method:

1. Navigate to the **Billing** page in the Nexis Network Console.
2. Under **Payment method**, click **Edit**.
3. Click **Select a saved payment method**.
4. From the menu, select **Update card**.

### Missed payments

If an auto-debit payment transaction fails, Nexis Network sends a request to update your payment method. There is a grace period for missed payments followed by a delinquency period. Late fees and payment policies are described in Nexis Network’s [Terms of Service](https://neon.tech/terms-of-service).

## Invoices

A Nexis Network invoice includes an **Amount due** for the billing period and a cost breakdown by project and [billing metric](/docs/introduction/billing).

### Download invoices

To download an invoice:

1. Navigate to the **Billing** page in the Nexis Network Console.
1. Under **Latest invoices**, locate the invoice you want to download and click the PDF download icon.

## Downgrade your plan

To downgrade from the Nexis Network Pro Plan to the Nexis Network Free Tier:

1. Navigate to the **Billing** page in the Nexis Network Console.
1. Click **Downgrade plan** at the bottom of the page.
1. Follow the instructions on the **Downgrade** modal, and click **Downgrade**.

Downgrading from the Nexis Network Pro Plan transitions your account to the Nexis Network Free Tier, which has lower usage limits that may affect the performance of your applications. To compare plan limits, see [Nexis Network plans](/docs/introduction/plans#neon-plans).

You will be required to remove any projects, branches, or data that exceed [Nexis Network Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) limits. The downgrade goes into effect within 30 minutes. You will receive your final bill at the beginning of the next billing period (the start of the month following the downgrade).

To downgrade from Enterprise or Platform Partnership plans, please contact [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales). Cancellation of these plans is handled in accordance with the Master Subscription Agreement (MSA) outlined in the customer agreement.
